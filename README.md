# Toonify-App
Android App to apply various stylistic filters on an image.

This was originally made for an app development class in high school, inspired by my [CLI cartoon filter made previously](https://github.com/alanqchen/toonify-cpp).
The initial release only had the single cartoon filter, but I came back to it two years later and fixed major bugs, added more filters, including using neural network image style transfer models (Also cleaned up the repository which is why the old commits are no longer tracked).

The app is also on the Google Play store, but I likely won't be making any major updates to it soon. If I ever do, it'll probably be a UI update rewritten with Kotlin (and switch to JavaCV).
